# [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) using reducers

Reducers is a reactive programming approach to creating applications.

Reducers allow you to process streams of data in real time by using and transforming processing functions. You don't have to create a bunch of interim array containers for that data, because your functions react to it *as it streams in*.

There are a bunch of happy side-effects to this approach:

* You don't need to do data-binding, ever. Since you're mapping and filtering from the same live stream, everything stays in sync automatically.
* You don't need to allocate memory to store your data if you don't want to. Your program reacts to the data as it streams in.

## Install

You'll need [Node][node] with [NPM][npm]. Once you've got that:

```sh
cd todomvc/architecture-examples/reducers
npm install
```

You'll also need [Browserify][browserify].

```sh
npm install -g browserify
```

## Usage

If you want to hack on the Todo app locally, you'll probably want to run a local server so you can preview your work. On OSX it's pretty easy, `cd` into the `todomvc` folder and:

```sh
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

After that, you'll need to run [Browserify][browserify], since we're using NodeJS-style CommonJS modules:

```sh
cd todomvc/architecture-examples/reducers
npm run browserify
```

Unfortunately [Browserify][browserify] watch is [broken on OSX 10.7][watch bug], but
there is a [fix][watch fix] that did not made it to upstream yet. As a
temporary workaround you could use that fix to get watch working:

```
git clone https://github.com/substack/node-browserify.git
cd node-browserify
curl https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/pull/190.patch | git am
npm install -g
```
